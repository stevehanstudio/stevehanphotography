    I made my first website, stevehanphoto.com, in 2002 to document my journey in photography and share my experiences.  Back than I was developing a passion for the electronic dance music, and it led to me managing the website, eventvibe.com.

    This website 
    
    It is now 2020, and for the past 2 years I've been learning the modern way to develop web applications.  This site is built with these modern tools using React, Gatsby.js, GraphQL and Cloudinary to be fast, interactive, and adaptive to a variety of device screen sizes.
