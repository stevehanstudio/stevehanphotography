I made my first website, stevehanphoto.com, in 2002 to document my journey in photography and share my experiences.  I loved to travel and back than I was developing a passion for electronic dance music, which led to me managing the website, eventvibe.com.

It is now 2020, and for the past 2 years I've been learning the modern way to develop web applications.  This site is built with these modern tools using React, Gatsby.js, Node.js, GraphQL and Cloudinary to be fast, interactive, and adaptive to a variety of device screen sizes.

From my travel photography and my coverage of the dance music scenes to my work in fashion, lifestyle, portraiture, food, drinks, technology events and videos, this website attempts to take you on a journey with me, bringing attention to the images and experiences that I hold my most dear to my heart and that has changed the course of my life.  It is still a work in progress.  Coming soon...weddings and bodyart.
