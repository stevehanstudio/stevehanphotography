    caption: In August 2002, I traveled to Ibiza and Barcelona, Spain.  At The Moorg (club) in Barcelona, it was almost pitch dark other than a spotlight by the DJ booth that flashes on and off every second or so.  I took this photo with my Sony point & shoot digital camera by trapping the camera and keeping the shutter open between multiple flashes.  This shot was the shot that inspired me to want to work with the dynamic lighting conditions of dance music events.

Portrait photography can range from a professional headshot for conveying a message of confidence or openess to capturing the spirit, essence or soul of a person.  It can be fashion inspired or it can be capturing a person at their natural state of being.
